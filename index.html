                <p>I am journalist turned tech entrepreneur, out to clear the internet of clickbait fake news that wastes time and
              makes it difficult to find legitimate news and information. I've worked stints as a full-time reporter at the New Orleans Times Picayune and Cleveland Plain Dealer,
             both of which were two of the nation's largest newspapers and both of which are now facing stifling economic strain
              as tech companies exert downward pressure on advertising prices in their markets. I hope to leverage my work into an application that can 
               rate online articles on the basis of quality and reliability.
